# level-index-simulator

# `sli` - A custom precision MATLAB symmetric level-index arithmetic simulator.

## About

`sli` is a MATLAB toolbox that provides sli objects and operations on them.

* [sli.m](sli.m) - the main object file.
* [tests](./tests) - various testing scripts that test the accuracy of representation and operations.
* [experiments](./experiments) - scripts to reproduce the experiments with level-index arithmetic in [1].

## Quick start

```
x = sli(2,12);
x = x.set_val(pi)
x = 

  sli with properties:

    level_bits: 2
    index_bits: 12
          sign: 0
    reciprocal: 1
         level: 2
         index: 0.135253906250000
         value: 3.141899100868418
```

### Installation

Clone the repository and add the root directory to the MATLAB search path.

## Requirements

The code was developed on MATLAB 2023b. Experiments make use of the [CPFloat](https://github.com/north-numerical-computing/cpfloat) package.
